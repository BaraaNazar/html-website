      <h1>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</h1>
      <p>
        Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads — his
        real father and the father of his best friend, his "rich dad" — and the
        ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing.
        The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be
        rich and explains the difference between working for money and having
        your money work for you.
