    <h1>The Art of War</h1>
    <p>
      Twenty-Five Hundred years ago, Sun Tzu wrote this classic book of military
      strategy based on Chinese warfare and military thought. Since that time,
      all levels of military have used the teaching on Sun Tzu to warfare and
      civilization have adapted these teachings for use in politics, business
      and everyday life. The Art of War is a book which should be used to gain
      advantage of opponents in the boardroom and battlefield alike.
